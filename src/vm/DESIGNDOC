			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
			=====================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

	vm/struct.h
	The following are the data structures that have been used for PAGE TABLE
	MANAGEMENT
	struct page_struct
	-------------------
		This data structure represents an entry in the supplemental page table.
		The data members of page_struct are as follows: 
			-> int type; An integer variable to identify the type of the page
			
			-> void *virtual_address; The virtual address of the page is stored here
			
			-> void *physical_address; The physical address is stored here
			
			-> bool writable; This boolean variable determines if page is
					writable or not. A true value indicates that it has write
					permissions
			
			-> uint32_t *pagedir;  pagedir of page
			
			-> struct list_elem frame_elem; list element for shared frame
			
			-> size_t index; This stores the index of swap block

			-> size_t read_bytes; read bytes
			
			-> size_t zero_bytes; zero bytes
			
			-> bool loaded; This determines if a page is loaded or not
			
			-> struct file *file; the file struct of the page
			
			-> off_t offset; //offset in the file
			
			-> off_t bid; //inode block index
			

	The following are the constants that have been defined under struct.h to
	identify the type of the file
		#define TYPE_ZERO 0
		#define TYPE_FILE 1
		#define TYPE_SWAP 2

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.
	
	When a frame needs to be accessed, it calls VM_get_page. There are two
	possibilities.

	If the frame has already been allocated previously, given the virtual
	address of the frame it obtains an entry in the thread's supplemental page
	table. Now, it's just a matter of comparing the page directories to obtain
	a page. Once done, I obtain the physical addresses of the frame and lookup
	the actual frame in the global frames hash table.

	If the frame has not been loaded, then I would evict old frames and
	allocate a new one.

>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

	I only set the page as accessed or dirty using virtual addresses. I never
	use the physical address for accesses after it has been swapped in. This
	gets over all aliasing issues successfully.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

	Before any process can access a frame, I lock the shared resource ensuring
	that only one process can access a frame at a time. The other process is
	made to wait on a lock semaphore.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

	When conducting VM routines, speed of access is of utmost importance. So,
	data structures such as hash maps (for frames) and bit maps(for swap
	slots) have been used instead of linked list or arrays.

		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

	vm/struct.h
	The following is the data structure that is used to represent a frame
	struct frame_struct
		-> void *physical_address; 
				Physical address of the frame

		-> bool persistent;		
				Determines if the frame is pinned or not
		
		-> struct list shared_pages; 
				List of all pages that share this frame
		
		-> struct list_elem frame_list_elem; 
				List element for the frames list
		
		-> struct lock page_list_lock; 
				Page access is synchronized using this lock
		
		-> struct hash_elem hash_elem; 
				This is required for hash frame table

	struct block *swap_block;
		This is used to identify a swap block

	struct bitmap *swap_bitmap;
		This is used to manage swap slots.

	size_t swap_size;
		The size of the swap is stored here.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

	I have used a variant of clock algorithm to implement frame eviction.

	evict() function in frame.c iterates through all the frames which inturn
	iterates through all the pages which are sharing the same frame. The
	access bit of each page is observed. If all are zero, the page is
	victimized and this is evicted.

>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?
	
	I am clearing the mappings in pagedir so that the page no longer can be
	accessed. I unload the contents to disk and remove the entry from hash
	table. Only then can P obtain the frame under question.

>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

	I check if the fault address is less than 32 bytes below the stack
	pointer. This works because PUSHA can push atmost 32 bytes at once.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)

	The various operations that needs to be done includes page loading,
	unloading, eviction etc. I have an array of locks defined in vm/struct.h
	which I use to synchronize all accesses. Such locks are used internally
	and whence will not cause deadlocks.

>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify
>> the page during the eviction process?  How do you avoid a race
>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?

	I have kept a lock which ensures P to complete it's eviction before Q can
	operate on the frame. After this Q may fault and bring it back it which is
	completely valid. Also, Q's frame is observed right at the end during the
	eviction process ensuring it's re-eviction unlikely.
	
>> B7: Suppose a page fault in process P causes a page to be read from
>> the file system or swap.  How do you ensure that a second process Q
>> cannot interfere by e.g. attempting to evict the frame while it is
>> still being read in?

	The eviction process simply ignores all pinned frames. A simple solution
	was to pin the frames while it is being read in.

>> B8: Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur
>> during system calls.  Do you use page faults to bring in pages (as
>> in user programs), or do you have a mechanism for "locking" frames
>> into physical memory, or do you use some other design?  How do you
>> gracefully handle attempted accesses to invalid virtual addresses?

	To prevent page faults, I 'pin' the frames to physical memory. This
	essentially means that I lock the frame and it can't be swapped out. Only
	after the read operation is finished do I unlock/unpin it.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: A single lock for the whole VM system would make
>> synchronization easy, but limit parallelism.  On the other hand,
>> using many locks complicates synchronization and raises the
>> possibility for deadlock but allows for high parallelism.  Explain
>> where your design falls along this continuum and why you chose to
>> design it this way.

	I chose to have multiple locks instead of one lock for the whole VM.
	Parallelism is the more important operating system feature and careful
	design allowed me to use locks carefully for synchronization.

			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

	vm/struct.h
	struct mmap_struct
		-> mapid_t mapid; 
				A unique ID to identify a map
		
		-> int fid; 
				A file descriptor
		
		-> struct hash_elem frame_hash_elem; 
				hash element for frame tables
		
		-> struct list_elem thread_mmap_list; 
				for thread's mmap list
		
		-> void *start_address;
		   void *end_address;
				a mapped file may span for multiple pages. This stores the
				start and end virtual addresses

	vm/thread.h
		struct list mmap_files
			This keeps a list of all memory mapped files


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

	A list of all memory mapped files is kept for echa thread as mmap_files. A
	hash table for memory mapped files is also kept. A new file is inserted
	into the hash table and loaded lazily when needed.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.
	
	To determine whether a new file mapping overlaps any existing maps, I
	divide the file into pages and check each of them for conflicting virtual
	address. This works because a virtual address is unique for each process.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of
>> data demand-paged from executables, except that "mmap" mappings are
>> written back to their original files, not to swap.  This implies
>> that much of their implementation can be shared.  Explain why your
>> implementation either does or does not share much of the code for
>> the two situations.

	My implementation shares most of the code. This is done to reduct the
	duplication and reduct work required to write the code.
