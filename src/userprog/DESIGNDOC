			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

	For the sole purpose of argument passing, no additional member functions
	were created. Also, none were modified.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?
	
	The argument passed to the `process_execute(*file_name)' function contains
	name of the file to execute along with the arguments to that process.
	Under the assumption that various arguments are delimited with a '
	'[space], I am using strtok_r function defined under 'lib/string.h' to
	parse the input by splitting the string into several tokens which can be
	accessed by successive calls to strok_r. These are then pushed to the
	stack.

	After word aligning the stack pointer, I am pushing the addresses of the
	arguments in reverse order. To achieve this, I have another pointer witch
	crawls up the stack looking for null terminated arguments. The address
	this obtained is stored in the location pointed by sp after decrementing
	it appropriately.

	The size stack page in PintOS is 4096 bytes. A check is made while adding
	the arguments to the stack to ensure that it never exceeds this value.
	This prevents overflowing of the stack page.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?
	
 	Both strtok_r() and strtok() perform the function of splitting the string
 	into several tokens which can be accessed by successive calls to
 	respective functions.

 	The difference is that the information about the next token is stored in
 	the space pointed to by the third argument, save_ptr, which is a pointer
 	to a string pointer. This enables reentrancy which is required by the
 	implementation.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

	The first design principle of a kernel is Minimality which says: 
		| "If it doesn't have to be in the kernel, it shouldn't be in the
		| kernel"
	By having Unix like implementation of separation of executable name and
	arguments, we can significantly reduce the complexity of the kernel.

	Also, with $PATH environment variable, it is easier for the shell to
	affirm the presence of the an executable. Finding the executable and other
	files is an expensive task and thus this task is best left to other user
	programs like the shell.

	The above were two advantages of the Unix approach.


			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
	
	threads/threads.h A new structure (unimaginatively called 'file_struct')
	was created to store various details pertaining to files. Also various new
	decelerations were made in `struct thread` to aid the implementation of
	system calls. All this is described below.

 		struct file_struct
 		------------------
 			
 			int fid; This is a file descriptor.
 			
 			struct list_elem thread_file_elem; This is the list element to
 				store a file in the files list (defined in threads structure).

 			struct file *f; A pointer to the an open file.

 		struct thread
 		-------------

 			bool process_exited; A flag to keep a tab to whether the process has
 				exited.
			
			bool process_waited; This is a boolean variable to check if a process has
				already waited for the child.

			struct semaphore sema_process_load;
			struct semaphore sema_process_wait;
			struct semaphore sema_process_exit;
				The above are three semaphores to synchronize the load, wait and store operations.

			struct thread *parent;// Parent process of the thread in question
				This is the pointer to the parent of the thread in question

			struct file *exec; This points to the file containing the thread
				executable.

			struct list files; This is a list of all files opened by the
				current thread.

			int ret_status; The return status of the thread is stored in this
				integer variable.


>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

	When a process opens a new file, a new file descriptor which is unique to
	a process is generated. The file_struct stores a pointer to the file along
	with this newly generated file descriptor.

	A file descriptor is guaranteed to be unique only within a single process.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

	The first step is to validate that the addresses to be read or written
	into is in a valid virtual address space accessible to the user. Any
	attempts to do otherwise will cause the process to exit with a return code
	of -1.

	The next step is to determine where the data needs to be read from written
	into or . This decision is made by observing the value of 'fd'. A value of
	0 indicates that the data must be read from the standard input. 1
	indicates that the data must be written to the standard output. Any other
	value would indicate the appropriate operation must be performed on a
	file.

	If the operation needs to be done on a file, I first obtain the file pointer
	from the given file descriptor. Then I perform the actual read or write by
	calling file_read() or file_write() functions as defined in filesys/file.h
	appropriately.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

	The first step is to verify the validity of all parameters. Apart from checking
	that the input argument is sound, I also check that the parent of the child
	that the process is waiting for is in fact itself. This ensures that a process
	does not wait for a child of some other process.

	I have a semaphore which is initialized to zero. Hence, any attempt by the
	process to down the semaphore by the wait function will cause it to get
	blocked. This provides the desired effect of a process waiting.

	It is only when the exit function of child ups the semaphore that the
	waiting process can proceed.

	Any attempt by the process to access a bad location will cause the process
	to page fault. The page fault handler inturn calls the exit function with
	a return code of -1. In my implementation it is the task of this exit
	function to free all locks and close of files and deallocate various other
	resources.

	For example, consider a part of code in page fault function
		if ((is_kernel_vaddr(fault_addr) && user) || not_present)
			system_call_exit(-1);
	Also consider the exit function
		if (lock_held_by_current_thread(&file_lock))
			lock_release(&file_lock);

		while (!list_empty(&t->files))
		{
			e = list_begin(&t->files);
			system_call_close(
			list_entry (e, struct file_struct, thread_file_elem)->fid);
		}
	It can be seen that all resources are appropriately closed after use.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

	I am using a semaphore which is initialized to 0. When the process_execute
	function tries to down this semaphore, it gets blocked. At the meantime,
	load operation can be performed at a leisurely pace and the semaphore is
	upped only after it's completion. Now the process_execute can continue and
	do the needful to verify the successful completion of load and report if
	otherwise.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you

>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?
	
	Case 1:	P calls wait(C) before C exits.
			In this case, P gets blocked until C exits after unblocking P
	Case 2: C exits before P calls wait(c).
			For this, I have maintained another semaphore (sema_exit) which
			blocks C until P waits for C

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

	The implementation for memory access is as concise as possible. I chose to
	validate accesses using the page fault mechanism with performance in mind.
	This is because it takes advantage of the processor's MMU. Also this
	method is used in real kernels like Linux enforcing the rationale of my
	decision to choose this method.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

	The main advantage of creating a structure to map file descriptor to the
	file is that they both can be accessed simultaneously. It is the best
	mapping strategy in my opinion. Using a helper function fd_to_file() I can
	easily obtain the file given it's fid.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

	No modifications were made in this regard.
