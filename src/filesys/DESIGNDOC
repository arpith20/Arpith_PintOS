---- PRELIMINARIES ----

>> If you have any preliminary comments on your submission, notes for the
>> TAs, or extra credit, please give them here.

Note 1:

	Please ensure that P4FILESYS symbol is defined in Make.vars (as
	-DP4FILESYS). I have defined this in my file, so ideally there should not
	be any problems. 

	This a heads up just in case your script does not read my (modified)
	Make.vars file.

Note 2:
	
	This project has been compiled using gcc version 5.2.1. (gcc-5) 
	
	While there is no reason why this should not compile using gcc-4 (which I
	believe you are using), I just thought that it is better to mention the
	same just in case some unintended compilation issues arise.

		     INDEXED AND EXTENSIBLE FILES
		     ============================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

	filesys/inode.h 
	struct struct inode_disk and inode
	----------------------------------
	The following modifications were amde to the inode and
	inode_disk data structure to implement indexed and extensible files

		block_sector_t block[115];
			This is a pointer to store direct blocks.

        uint32_t inode_data[10];                  
            This contains various miscellaneous data pertaining to indexing
            information, directory implementation etc.

    struct struct iblock_struct
	---------------------------
	This structure uas created to store all the indirect block pointers.

		uint32_t block[128];
			This is a pointer to store indirect blocks.


>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by your inode
>> structure?  Show your work.

	Total number of blocks 	= 
								  Number of direct blocks 
								+ no of single indirect blocks 
								+ no of double indirect blocks
							= 113 + 128 + (128*128) 
							= 16625

	Maximum size of file 	= no of blocks * size of each block
							= 16625 * 512
							= 8512000 bytes
							= 8312 KB
							= 8.12 MB

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A3: Explain how your code avoids a race if two processes attempt to
>> extend a file at the same time.

	In such a scenario, the process which runs first would extend the file.
	The next one would see an extended file and would not try to extend it
	again. 

>> A4: Suppose processes A and B both have file F open, both
>> positioned at end-of-file.  If A reads and B writes F at the same
>> time, A may read all, part, or none of what B writes.  However, A
>> may not read data other than what B writes, e.g. if B writes
>> nonzero data, A is not allowed to see all zeros.  Explain how your
>> code avoids this race.

	In my implementation, only one of the process can open a file F. So, in
	the above situation, either A would read F first, or B would write into F
	first. All operations are mutually exclusive.

>> A5: Explain how your synchronization design provides "fairness".
>> File access is "fair" if readers cannot indefinitely block writers
>> or vice versa.  That is, many processes reading from a file cannot
>> prevent forever another process from writing the file, and many
>> processes writing to a file cannot prevent another process forever
>> from reading the file.

	The concept of 'fairness' has not been incorporated into my design. It
	upto the programmer of the application to design it such that a fair
	access to the files can be provided.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Is your inode structure a multilevel index?  If so, why did you
>> choose this particular combination of direct, indirect, and doubly
>> indirect blocks?  If not, why did you choose an alternative inode
>> structure, and what advantages and disadvantages does your
>> structure have, compared to a multilevel index?

	Yes. My inode structure uses multilevel indexing. The main reason for
	doing this is to maximize the file size supported by the system and this
	is it's major advantage. However, this also increases the number of disk
	accesses to locate the block which is require.

			    SUBDIRECTORIES
			    ==============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

	threads/thread.h
	struct thread
	-------------
		struct dir *working_dir;
			This is a directory pointer to store the current working directory
			for that thread.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path.  How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?

	To determine if the given path is absolute or relative, the first
	character is checked to see if its either '/' or '.'. It it is a '/' then
	it is determined that the given path is absolute and I start from the root
	directory. In the other case, once we have determined that the path is
	relative, we start from the current working directory.

	The next step is to parse the path and determine what the parsed token
	means. It can be one of the following cases:

	case 1: if (strstr(curr_token, ".") == NULL || (strlen(file_name) != 1 &&
				strlen(file_name) != 2))
		This means that I am looking at a file or a directory.

	case 2: if (strcmp(curr_token, '.') == 0)
		This means current directory.

	case 3: if (strcmp('..', curr_token) == 0)
		This means I have to go to previous directory.

	The above 3 cases encompasses all valid situations required to traverse a
	valid user-specified path.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B4: How do you prevent races on directory entries?  For example,
>> only one of two simultaneous attempts to remove a single file
>> should succeed, as should only one of two simultaneous attempts to
>> create a file with the same name, and so on.

	Adding or removing a directory requires a file_lock. Hence only one
	process can perform operations at any specified time thus eliminating all
	possibilities of races.

>> B5: Does your implementation allow a directory to be removed if it
>> is open by a process or if it is in use as a process's current
>> working directory?  If so, what happens to that process's future
>> file system operations?  If not, how do you prevent it?

	No. This is not allowed. A function dir_remove_validate ensures that a
	directory is not removed if it is not empty or is being used by some other
	process.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B6: Explain why you chose to represent the current directory of a
>> process the way you did.
	
	In my implementation, a pointer of the type dir points to the current
	directory. A simple pointer seemed like the easiest way to implement as
	opposed to having a inode etc.

			     BUFFER CACHE
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

	filesys/filesys.h
	The following data structure was created to aid the working of buffer
	cache

		struct buffer_struct
		--------------------
			bool dirty;
				Determines that some data was written to the buffer.
			
			bool access;
				A flag to know that the buffer was accessed (read/write).
			
			uint8_t content[BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE];
				The contents in the buffer is stored here.
			
			uint32_t sector;
				Each data is stored on some sector on the disk. This stores
				this information

			struct list_elem buffer_listelem;
				A list element for buffer_list

		lock_init(&buffer_lock);
			A lock for buffer synchronization

		buffer_size = 0;
			Determines the current size of the buffer. Max is 64.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how your cache replacement algorithm chooses a cache
>> block to evict.

	Every time a cache block is accessed, a accessed flag is set to true and
	if the data in the cache is modified, then dirty flag is set to true.
	Finally, a dirty block which has not been accessed is chosen to be
	evicted. buffer_evict() function performs this operation.

>> C3: Describe your implementation of write-behind.

	Before shutting down the file system module, all entries marked as dirty
	are written to the disk.

>> C4: Describe your implementation of read-ahead.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C5: When one process is actively reading or writing data in a
>> buffer cache block, how are other processes prevented from evicting
>> that block?

	I am using a buffer_lock to prevent to synchronize the read/write/evict
	operations.

>> C6: During the eviction of a block from the cache, how are other
>> processes prevented from attempting to access the block?

	A buffer_lock is used which prevents multiple processes from accessing the
	block.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C7: Describe a file workload likely to benefit from buffer caching,
>> and workloads likely to benefit from read-ahead and write-behind.

	Buffer caching is likely to benefit when reading short files.
	Read ahead is likely to benefit when reading a complete file.
	Write behind is likely to benefit when writing small bytes to file.
