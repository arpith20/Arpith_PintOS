## Introduction

This is [my](http://arpith.xyz) implementation of various OS features which includes:

1. [Threads](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/10wi-cs140/pintos/pintos_2.html#SEC15)
2. [User Programs](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/10wi-cs140/pintos/pintos_3.html#SEC32) 
3. [Virtual Memory](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/10wi-cs140/pintos/pintos_4.html#SEC53) and
4. [File System](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/10wi-cs140/pintos/pintos_5.html#SEC75)

It was done as part of OS course (E0 253) at the Indian Institute of Science.
